Important Note
--------------

It is not necessary to compile AsmTool programs, but
if you want to:

Nasm version 2.0 will not compile AsmTools because
the "-f elf"  parameter defaults to 64 bit mode.
We want "-f elf32" or 32 bit mode.  This will be
changed in Nasm's next version.  The easy solution
is to use another version of namm.

------------------------------------------------

These are generic install instructions for the
AsmTool family of programs.

AsmTool programs only run on x86 Linux systems
and do not need to be compiled first.  Install
as root by typing:

   make install

If a compile is desired, simply type make.  All
this should work without problems if the following
programs are available:

  asmlib - library included in AsmTools
  asmlibx - x library, only used by AsmBug

  bash - or possibly sh needed by makefile
  sed - stream editor (almost always available)
  make - GNU make needed for install,compile
  install - needed to copy programs
  strip - needed by install to remove debug info.
  nasm -  needed by compile
  asmpub - (optional) used by AsmLib "make doc" option

The Makefile also has options for uninstall, documentation,
and cleanup.  

Details
-------

AsmTool programs each have a separate makefile and can
be installed individually.  It is also possilbe to
obtain the complete source tree and compile everything.

The easiest way to work with AsmTools is to obtain the
complete package because this includes the library
that is needed for compiles, and all the documentation
that is make available by AsmRef.

The common makefile options are:

  make clean - clean up the source tree
  make       - make executables
  make doc   - make documentation
  make release - create a tar.gz file
  make install - run as "root" to install
  make uninstall - run as "root" to uninstall

Limitations
-----------

The bookmarks in AsmFile and AsmMgr are lost with a new install.

The file and directory structure is assumed to use short file names
without spaces inside the name.  For example a directory name could b:
  
  "This is a very long directory name"

The above name would work with some AsmTool programs but not others.
Also, long names would soon overflow the internal buffers.  Internal
buffers expect directory paths and names to be less than 200 bytes.
