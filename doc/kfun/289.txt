289 ioprio_set  - set I/O scheduling priority
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  mov  eax,289
  mov  ebx,op
  mov  ecx,p1
  mov  edx,p2
  int  80h

   Set the I/O scheduling class and priority of one or more processes.

args
----

 ebx This argument determines how the argument in ecx is interpreted,
   and has one of the following values:

	IOPRIO_WHO_PROCESS = 1
	IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP = 2
	IOPRIO_WHO_USER = 3

   IOPRIO_WHO_PROCESS ecx contains a process ID identifying a single
   process.
   IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP ecx contains a process group ID identifying all the
   members of a process group.
   IOPRIO_WHO_USER ecx contains a user ID identifying all of the
   processes that have a matching real UID.

 ecx This arguments depends on the value of ebx. See above.

 edx A bit mask that specifies both the scheduling class and the
   priority to be assigned to the target process(es). The ioprio value is
   assembled in the following way:
   (class shl IOPRIO_CLASS_SHIFT) or data
   Where class is the scheduling class and data is the priority. (See the
   Remarks section for more information on scheduling classes and
   priorities.)
   I/O priorities are supported for reads and for synchronous (O_DIRECT,
   O_SYNC) writes. I/O priorities are not supported for asynchronous
   writes because they are issued outside the context of the program
   dirtying the memory, and thus program-specific priorities do not
   apply.

Return values

   If the system call succeeds the return value is 0.
   If the system call fails the return value is one of the following
   errno values:

   -EPERM The calling process does not have the privilege needed to
     assign this ioprio to the specified process(es). See the Remarks
     section for more information on required privileges for
     sys_ioprio_set.
   -ESRCH No process(es) could be found that matched the specification in
     ebx and ecx.
   -EINVAL Invalid value for ebx.


   This system call only has an effect when used in conjunction with an
   I/O scheduler that supports I/O priorities. As at kernel 2.6.17 the
   only such scheduler is the Completely Fair Queuing (CFQ) I/O
   scheduler.

   Selecting an I/O Scheduler:
   I/O Schedulers are selected on a per-device basis via the special file
   /sys/block/<device>/queue/scheduler.
   One can view the current I/O scheduler via the /sys file system. For
   example, the following command displays a list of all schedulers
   currently loaded in the kernel:

   $ cat /sys/block/hda/queue/scheduler
   noop anticipatory deadline [cfq]

   The scheduler surrounded by brackets is the one actually in use for
   the device (hda in the example). Setting another scheduler is done by
   writing the name of the new scheduler to this file. For example, the
   following command will set the set the scheduler for the hda device to
   cfq:

   $ su Password: # echo cfq > /sys/block/hda/queue/scheduler

   The Completely Fair Queuing (CFQ) I/O Scheduler:

   Since v3 (aka CFQ Time Sliced) CFQ implements I/O nice levels similar
   to those of CPU scheduling. These nice levels are grouped in three
   scheduling classes each one containing one or more priority levels:
   IOPRIO_CLASS_RT This is the real-time I/O class. This scheduling class
   is given higher priority than any other class: processes from this
   class are given first access to the disk every time. Thus this I/O
   class needs to be used with some care: one I/O real-time process can
   starve the entire system. Within the real-time class, there are 8
   levels of class data (priority) that determine exactly how much time
   this process needs the disk for on each service. The highest real-time
   priority level is 0; the lowest is 7. In the future this might change
   to be more directly mappable to performance, by passing in a desired
   data rate instead.

   IOPRIO_CLASS_BE This is the best-effort scheduling class, which is the
   default for any process that hasn't set a specific I/O priority. The
   class data (priority) determines how much I/O bandwidth the process
   will get. Best-effort priority levels are analogous to CPU nice values
   (see [1]sys_getpriority). The priority level determines a priority
   relative to other processes in the best-effort scheduling class.
   Priority levels range from 0 (highest) to 7 (lowest).

   IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE This is the idle scheduling class. Processes running
   at this level only get I/O time when no one else needs the disk. The
   idle class has no class data. Attention is required when assigning
   this priority class process, since it may become starved if higher
   priority processes are constantly accessing the disk.

   Refer to Documentation/block/ioprio.txt for more information on the
   CFQ I/O Scheduler and an example program.
   Required permissions to set I/O priorities:

   Permission to change a process's priority is granted or denied based
   on two assertions:

   Process ownership: An unprivileged process may only set the I/O
   priority of a process whose real UID matches the real or effective UID
   of the calling process. A process which has the CAP_SYS_NICE
   capability can change the priority of any process.

   Attempts to set very high priorities
   (IOPRIO_CLASS_RT) or very low ones (IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE) require the
   CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability. A call to sys_ioprio_set must follow both
   rules, or the call will fail with the error -EPERM.
