290 ioprio_get  - get I/O scheduling priority

   Get the I/O scheduling class and priority of one or more processes.

args
----

 ebx This argument determines how the argument in ecx is interpreted,
   and has one of the following values:

   IOPRIO_WHO_PROCESS ecx contains a process ID identifying a single
   process.

   IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP ecx contains a process group ID identifying all the
   members of a process group.

   IOPRIO_WHO_USER ecx contains a user ID identifying all of the
   processes that have a matching real UID.
   If ebx is specified as IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP or IOPRIO_WHO_USER when calling
   sys_ioprio_get, and more than one process matches ecx, then the
   returned priority will be the highest one found among all of the
   matching processes. One priority is said to be higher than another one
   if it belongs to a higher priority class (IOPRIO_CLASS_RT is the
   highest priority class; IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE is the lowest) or if it
   belongs to the same priority class as the other process but has a
   higher priority level (a lower priority number means a higher priority
   level).

 ecx This arguments depends on the value of ebx. See above.

Return values

   If the system call succeeds the return value is ioprio value of the
   process with highest I/O priority of any of the processes that match
   the criteria specified in ebx and ecx. ioprio value can be dissected
   to its class and data components in the following way:

   class component (IOPRIO_CLASS_RT, IOPRIO_CLASS_BE, or
   IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE.):

   ioprio shr IOPRIO_CLASS_SHIFT

   priority (data) component:

   ioprio and IOPRIO_PRIO_MASK

   If the system call fails the return value is one of the following
   errno values:

   -ESRCH No process(es) could be found that matched the specification in
     ebx and ecx.
   -EINVAL Invalid value for ebx.

   This system call only has an effect when used in conjunction with an
   I/O scheduler that supports I/O priorities. As at kernel 2.6.17 the
   only such scheduler is the Completely Fair Queuing (CFQ) I/O
   scheduler.

   Selecting an I/O Scheduler:

   I/O Schedulers are selected on a per-device basis via the special file
   /sys/block/<device>/queue/scheduler.
   One can view the current I/O scheduler via the /sys file system. For
   example, the following command displays a list of all schedulers
   currently loaded in the kernel:

   $ cat /sys/block/hda/queue/scheduler
   noop anticipatory deadline [cfq]

   The scheduler surrounded by brackets is the one actually in use for
   the device (hda in the example). Setting another scheduler is done by
   writing the name of the new scheduler to this file. For example, the
   following command will set the set the scheduler for the hda device to
   cfq:

   $ su Password: # echo cfq > /sys/block/hda/queue/scheduler

   The Completely Fair Queuing (CFQ) I/O Scheduler:
   Since v3 (aka CFQ Time Sliced) CFQ implements I/O nice levels similar
   to those of CPU scheduling. These nice levels are grouped in three
   scheduling classes each one containing one or more priority levels:

   IOPRIO_CLASS_RT This is the real-time I/O class. This scheduling class
   is given higher priority than any other class: processes from this
   class are given first access to the disk every time. Thus this I/O
   class needs to be used with some care: one I/O real-time process can
   starve the entire system. Within the real-time class, there are 8
   levels of class data (priority) that determine exactly how much time
   this process needs the disk for on each service. The highest real-time
   priority level is 0; the lowest is 7. In the future this might change
   to be more directly mappable to performance, by passing in a desired
   data rate instead.

   IOPRIO_CLASS_BE This is the best-effort scheduling class, which is the
   default for any process that hasn't set a specific I/O priority. The
   class data (priority) determines how much I/O bandwidth the process
   will get. Best-effort priority levels are analogous to CPU nice values
   (see [1]sys_getpriority). The priority level determines a priority
   relative to other processes in the best-effort scheduling class.
   Priority levels range from 0 (highest) to 7 (lowest).

   IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE This is the idle scheduling class. Processes running
   at this level only get I/O time when no one else needs the disk. The
   idle class has no class data. Attention is required when assigning
   this priority class process, since it may become starved if higher
   priority processes are constantly accessing the disk.
   Refer to Documentation/block/ioprio.txt for more information on the
   CFQ I/O Scheduler and an example program.
