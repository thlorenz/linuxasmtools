  Copies value from the source operand to the destination
  operand.  If the destination is SS interrupts are disabled except
  on early buggy 808x CPUs.  Some CPUs disable interrupts if the
  destination is any of the segment registers
  Flags: None

movsb,movsw,movsd  Move string
  Syntax:       movxx
   move data from [esi] to [edi]
   and increment both pointers.
  Copies data from addressed by ESI (even if operands are given) to
  the location EDI destination and updates ESI and EDI based on the
  size of the operand or instruction used.  ESI and EDI are incremented
  when the Direction Flag is cleared and decremented when the Direction
  Flag is Set.  Use with REP prefixes.

   If operand is op8, unsigned AX = AL * op8
   If operand is op16, unsigned DX::AX = AX * op16
  Unsigned multiply of the accumulator by the source.  If "src" is
  a byte value, then AL is used as the other multiplicand and the
  result is placed in AX.  If "src" is a word value, then AX is
  multiplied by "src" and DX:AX receives the result.  If "src" is
  a double word value, then EAX is multiplied by "src" and EDX:EAX
  receives the result.  The 386+ uses an early out algorithm which
  makes multiplying any size value in EAX as fast as in the 8 or 16
