  2.  Introduction

  The BIOS (boot code) is contained in ROM (Read Only Memory)
  and includes startup code plus configuration menus.  After
  a system boots programs are provided virtual memory and
  ignores the BIOS memory area.  This program finds the BIOS
  in physical memory and displays information stored by
  manufacturer.

  The sample program is built from two files: bios.asm and
  bios.inc.

  3. Where is physical memory

  To get at physical memory we need to read the device
  /dev/mem.  This device also can use the seek function
  or it can be mapped with mmap.  We will use the open,
  seek, read functions to search for the BIOS area.

  Before starting it is a good idea to check our status
  as follows:

  call	sys_getuid	;asmlib call to get our UID
  or	eax,eax		;check if root
  jz	we_root		;jmp if root


  Next, we open the physical memory device with:

  mov	ebx,mem_dev
  call	block_open_read

  The opened device handle is returned in eax, we
  use it to seek to address 0e0000h.  At this point
  we will begin our search.

  mov	[mem_handle],eax
  mov	ebx,eax		;handle to ebx
  mov	ecx,0e0000h	;seek offset
  mov	[current_seek],ecx
  call	block_seek

  4. How do we find the BIOS

  We are now at address 0e0000h in physical memory.
  Now, we want to search for the string "_DMI_" which
  indicates the top of BIOS tables.

dmi_search:
  mov	ecx,buffer
  mov	edx,16		;size of read
  call	block_read	;read 16 bytes
  cmp	[ecx],dword '_DMI'
  je	got_dmi
  add	[current_seek],dword 16
  dec	ebp		;timeout
  jnz	dmi_search


  If we have a standard plug-and-play BIOS, it
  will have a standard format.  We can scan the
  tables and extract the manufacturer and BIOS
  author.


  5. Running the example program.

  If we currently have root status, the example program
  can be started with:

  ./bios

  It will show date values read from bios. Normally
  we will not be root, so we might us sudo as follows:

  sudo ./bios

  6. Compiling the example program.

  The example program can be compiled with the
  following tools:

  nasm - assembler
  asmlib - library of assembler functions

  The easy way to do this is to install, asmide
  and start it as follows:

  asmide bios.asm

  asmide will provide a menu, with compile and
  debug options.

  To manually compile the source use the following:

  nasm -g -f elf bios.asm
  ld bios.o -static -o bios /usr/lib/asmlib.a
