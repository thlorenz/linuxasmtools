Installing
----------

see file INSTALL for more information.
The AsmTool package consists of many programs which
can be installed separatly.  All programs are
selfcontained but the file managers and asmedit
assume other programs are available.

The easiest way to get started is to install the
complete package (AsmTools).  To read the documentation
install AsmRef and execute it in a terminal.  If sudo
isn't available use "su". 

   cd AsmRef
   sudo make install
   asmref


Limitations
-----------

AsmTool programs only run on X86 processors using
the Linux kernel version 2.4 or later.  It isn't
portable to other UNIX flavors but over 90 percent
of all UNIX installations are for Linux X86.

Most AsmTools runs in a console and terminal.  When
run in the console, only keyboard commands are
available. The console/terminal programs are
built using asmlib.

AsmTools that require a x server are:
  asmbug - debugger
  tracex - trace x server communication
  xhelper - automate desktop programss
  asmlibx - library needed to build asmbug
            and xhelper


Features
--------

Many of the AsmTool programs are described within
AsmRef and that may be a good place to begin.  Each
program also has some additional documentation in
the source files.
